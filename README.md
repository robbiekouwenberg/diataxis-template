**[Features](#features) â€¢ [Get Started](#get-started)**

This project can be used as a template for repository documentation.
It's goal is two-fold:

- provide usage examples on how a diataxis based documentation could work including features from mkdocs that allow lighting up the content.
- provide a drop-in documentation framework anyone can just intall into their repository

To see a working example, see [diataxis-template](https://diataxis-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Pro-tip: make sure you add the link to the working example so you can off-load learning how to use the template to the example
