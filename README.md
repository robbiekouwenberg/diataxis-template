**[Features](#features) â€¢ [Get Started](#get-started)**

This project can be used as a template for repository documentation.
It's goal is two-fold:
1) provide usage examples on how a diataxis based documentation could work including features from mkdocs that allow lighting up the content.
2) provide a drop-in documentation framework anyone can just intall into their repository

To see a working example, see [diataxis-template](https://diataxis-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Before use, you need docker working

    git clone https://github.com/robbiekouwenberg/diataxis-template.git
    cd diataxis-template
    Run.ps1

Navigate with your web browser to:
  
  http://localhost:8000


You can edit/add/remove the md files. (Updating mkdocs.yml file accordingly)
