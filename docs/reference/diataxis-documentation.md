- [Concepts (explanation)](https://diataxis.fr/explanation): understanding-oriented
    - Here you add pages explaining concepts that are relevant to the domain, for instance [Working with documentation](/concepts/working-with-documentation).
- [How-to guides](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides): goal-oriented
    - Here you add pages that contain tutorials, for instance [How-to: start the local documentation server](/how-to/start-local-documentation-server).
- [Reference](https://diataxis.fr/reference): information-oriented
    - Here you add pages that contain reference information, for instance about [Diataxis documentation](/reference/diataxis-documentation).
