# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

These are the records of design decisions for future reference in order to understand why things are the way they are.
They are not permanent, we can change them in the future if better alternatives become available.

see [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/decisions/adr-template.html for an example.
